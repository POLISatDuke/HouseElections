This visualization shows the results of U.S. House of Representatives elections. 
                  The statebin map on the left side of the page shows the results in a particular year, 
                  which you can select using the slider input in the sidebar.
                  In the election summary view (the default), you can compare how well a state's elected officials actually match the
                  votes cast on election day (in terms of party membership) using the "Representation Ratio." 
                  This is a limited measure, since smaller states with only one or a small number of 
                  districts will naturally have more extreme ratios, and not all vote count data are available. But there are larger states
                  that consistently over-represent particular parties, which could indicate gerrymandering.
                  </br>If you instead select one of the major parties (step 2), the states will colored according to the criterion you choose in step 3:
                  <ul>
                  <li>"Winning Votes" shows the percentage of votes cast for candidates of the chosen party that won their election.</li>
                  <li>"Losing Votes" is the opposite; it shows what fraction of a party's votes went to losing candidates.</li>
                  <li>"Excess Votes" is the difference between the winner's vote share and the runner-up's vote share.
                  It is smaller in close elections and larger in landslides.</li>
                  <li>"Wasted Votes" is the percentage of votes that were cast for a losing candidate or for a winning candidate in excess of the runner-up.
                  In principle, these people could have stayed home on election day and the result of the election would not have changed. (Losing + Excess = Wasted).</li>
                  </ul>
                  <center><h4>"Wasted" Votes?</h4></center>
                  We show "wasted" votes here as a crude measure of how well-represented a state's electorate is, but the name "wasted" is imprecise and should not be taken too literally.
                  If a population somehow cooperated to reduce the number of wasted votes (without changing their political preferences), 
                  the equilibrium result would be just one person going to vote for the most popular candidate on election day and everyone else staying home.
                  This is technically a dictatorship, and certainly not how we should want elections to be run.
