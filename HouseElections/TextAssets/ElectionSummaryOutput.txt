      </br>The "Representation Ratio" is calculated by dividing the proportion of elected representatives from
      a party by the proportion of votes won by that party. For example, a Republican ratio of 2 means that,
      by proportion, there are twice as many Republican representatives as Republican votes. States are colored
      by which party is most overrepresented and saturated according to the degree of over-representation.
      </br>If you choose "Votes by Party" or "House Seats by Party," each state will be colored in 
      proportion to the fraction of votes or representatives belonging to a particular party. Click on a state to see
